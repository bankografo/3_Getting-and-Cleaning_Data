### Goal of the Project

1. Create a tidy data set 
2. Provide a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis 
3. Prepare the code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
4. Run_Analysis R Script
